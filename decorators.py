def monkeypatch(target, **attributes):
    """
    Decorator factory for setting attributes on a target object temporarily.

    When a function is decorated using an expression that is a call to this
    parameterized decorator, it causes the decorated function to patch in the
    attributes passed as keyword arguments when called, and to unpatch them
    when control exits it (either by returning or due to an exception).

    Attributes are unpatched in the reverse of the order in which they are
    patched. Although an exception from the decorated function must not prevent
    unpatching, if an exception is raised while attempting to unpatch an
    attribute then any remaining still-patched attributes won't be unpatched.
    However, if patching an attribute fails, then any attributes already
    patched will still be unpatched (and still in reverse order).

    Functions decorated with @monkeypatch(...) may themselves be recursive, but
    recursion is not used in any way in the implementation of monkeypatch.
    Decorating a function @monkeypatch(target, **attributes) augments its time
    and space complexity by O(attributes), and never more.

    For simplicity, it is assumed that all attributes to patch already exist.
    However, if that turns out not to be the case, then the above requirements
    still hold with respect to any resulting exceptions.

def mock_time(func):
    """
    Decorator to cause time.sleep to only simulate the passage of time.

    Adding this decorator to a function definition makes the function think its
    calls to time.sleep (and those due to functions it calls) have taken the
    amount of time, in seconds, passed to time.sleep, at least if the function
    uses time.perf_counter to check. But it is a lie. Instead, time.sleep and
    time.perf_counter conspire to lie to it.

    It is dangerous to mock time. The lie is told to functions called by the
    decorated function that themselves use time.sleep and time.perf_counter, as
    well as affecting any code running on another thread between when the
    decorated function is called and when it returns. In particular, if
    time.sleep is used to wait between performing actions over a network that
    must be rate limited, such as requests to a REST API, then the host may
    temporarily (or in some cases permanently) block the host.

    Therefore, as in other mocking scenarios, it's worth considering dependency
    injection as an alternative to monkey-patching. In dependency injection, a
    function that sleeps and checks time would receive sleep and perf_counter
    implementations when called, or be a method of a class instantiated with
    them. Then, in testing, it can use mock implementations without disrupting
    other parts of the system. This decorator is for when that can't be done.

    The decorated function does not lose track of actually elapsed time. All
    discrepancies are due to time.sleep. When time actually passes, such as due
    to a computation, that is reflected in the passage of time as shown by
    time.perf_counter.
